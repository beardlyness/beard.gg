          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <p>I go by beardlyness or ("beard" | "beardly") and I've been around helping with various types of projects for over 10+ Years now.</p>
          <p>Most of what I know is self taught from reading books, references and manuals. I've dabbled in System Management, Networking, Progamming, Automation, and AI.</p>
          <p>I've worked with many Operating Systems (Debian/Ubuntu, RHEL/CentOS/Fedora, OpenBSD/FreeBSD) and in different architectures (amd64/X86_64, i386, ARM)</p>
